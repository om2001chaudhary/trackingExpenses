# Writing exercise
Hello reader, in this article i will tell you some intresting thing about python programming language which i like most and make difference from others programming language so let's start i will not talk about feature of python but i bring you little bit deeper in python programming language when i startded to learn python i heard everything is object in python, i was little confuse what does it mean and when i got clear picture about this meny confusion get clear related to others topic too.

This is really nice you can find out everything about the object, what are the actions we can perform on it and it makes us life easer in programming language. it provides you meny builtin functions and library that is really helpfull for a programmer and it is known as a modular programming also. The best thing is you can take intractive help to know about object. you dont have to remember all the methods and functions what you have to know how to use it.

This is pure dynamically typed language. you can create number of variable of a singlr object and all variable will point to the same memory location. i learned other programming language also but i didn't comfortable with them, python is the programmimg language any one can write code doesn't mean he/she belongs to computer science. This is really a lovable programming language. There are so many intresting thing about it but for the time being i just finish it. Thanks
